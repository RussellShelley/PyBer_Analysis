# PyBer Analysis
## Pyber Weekly Fares by City Type.

## Overview 

In this analysis we will looking at PyBer's fares collected across different types of city: Urban, Suburban and Rural. We will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, that includes for each city type the:total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Then we will look at our data in a given time period and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will then be able to see how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
