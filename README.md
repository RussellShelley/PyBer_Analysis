# PyBer Analysis
## Pyber Fares by City Type.

## Overview 

In this analysis we will looking at PyBer's fares collected across different types of city: Urban, Suburban and Rural. We will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, that includes for each city type the:total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Then we will look at our data in a given time period and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each city plotted using weekly figures. We will then be able to see how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

### Total rides
 * Urban cities have by far the most rides at 1625.
  * Suburban cities have 625.
  * Rural cities have 125. 

  ### Total Drivers

* Suburban cities have about 50% at $19,356.33
* Rural cities make $4327.93


### Average fare per ride

* Rural rides are the most lucrative at $34.62. Perhaps, due to the greater distances between locales.  
* Suburban rides average $30.97
* Urban rides are the cheapest averaging $24.53.

### Average fare per driver
* Rural drivers bring the highest fare per driver. $55.49
* Suburban drivers average $39.50

![Total Fare By City Type](analysis/Total_Fare_By_City_Type.png)
### Total fares by city type.(January 2019 through April 2019)

* We can see that Urban cities acrue the highest total fares. Up $2500 a week, rarely below $2000

* Suburban cities have second highest totals. ~ $800 to $1400 a week.

* Rural cities are a lot lower, the highest total is ~$500 but they are usually around half that.

* The third week of Febuary was a great week for all city types.



## Summary
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

* Although rural cities provide least revenue. The individual drivers earn the most.  Adding more high earning rural drivers could help increase rural revenue.

* Urban cities have the highest total drivers and fares, but the lowest averages for per driver and per trip fares.  This is likely due to urban folk taking shorter rides.  If we looked to ways of encouraging riders to travel further, perhaps partnering/advertising with destinations on the perifories of town such as airports, theme parks we could increase driver averages.
